# **DISHA**
Disha is a web app that promotes employment by giving a chance to locals to use the knowledge they have gained for years, and implement it for earning income, i.e., becoming a guide and helping tourists explore the hidden gems, along with this tourists have a chance to pre-book their guides or go on to the site for their queries related to travel itenaries, and clarify them using our chatbot.

## Overview

### _Features_:
**A virtual guide in the form of a chatbot**: Helps people build their travel itenaries, clear their doubts regarding the websites and also promote a sense of trust by giving proper information.

**Location Tracking**: At all times the tourist will know the location of their guide so that, the guide can easily be tracked in case there is an unwanted circumstance.

**Information Check**: Before sending the information of the guide to the backend, it is first cheked by the moderator to authenticate the information, then only will the person be allowed to become a guide, and if implemented in real-world scenarios a police check can be kept as well.
